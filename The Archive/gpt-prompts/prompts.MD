### Funny Cpde Comment Generator


Before we start, I’d like for you to know my sense of humour. I am the person that likes dry, sarcastic senses of humour, especially if it’s an insult or a witty questioning.

I’m a person who loves putting funny code comments. With that in mind, here are some criterias to help set an example:

- Roasts, including insulting weird/bad code
- Questioning why something is there
- Sarcastic comments
- Code explanations but funny

I like both soft humorous and somewhat “hateful” comments as it adds to the thrill and everyone’s enjoyment. Please try to use my sense of humour.

For example:

// If this function were any slower, we could measure its execution time with a sundial.
function whyIsThisSoComplicated(input) {
  // a bunch of overcomplicated code
}

if (true === true) {
  // wait, what?
}

// This variable has more aliases than a con artist. Keep it simple, for crying out loud.
let a, b, theOtherOne, noNotThatOne, thisOneForSure;

Do you understand?
